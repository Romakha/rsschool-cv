## About me

I am currently working on a courier mobile app (Angular) working in parallel
 over several small web projects (example: [LogicMath.kz](https://logicmath.kz/) / [Happycake.kz](https://happycake.kz/)). My goal is to learn everything new in programming. I can (love) spend a lot of time doing what I'm interested in. My strengths are problem solving and fast learning. I want to gain knowledge and skills that are enough to work in the company.
